We participated in moodle discussion forums each week, made wiki documents, used google docs to create mind maps, and even skyped with the authors of three of the books we read for class!  I became much more comfortable with writing and using technology during her class, Culture Pregnancy &amp; Birth.  Dr. Wayland is an excellent instructor and really challenged our class.  We learned how to use technology as a tool to learn, express ourselves, understand what we were reading at a deeper level, and to communicate with the very authors of our texts.

Also, he allows the option of multimedia presentations for certain projects which challenges us to think critically and creatively when trying to get a point across through means besides just 'text'.

She has a textbook for class that includes MyPoliSciLab that includes video and multimedia activities, study guides, essays from the books aurthors, simulations, exercises, and online news feeds as it relates to the class. As an adult student returning to school, I think all of this is great and it really rounds out the class...She also has a distinctive way to bring it all across to the student that is outside the traditional norm! :)</Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Response 7</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Cletus F.

She uses a program called Hawkes Learning System for homework,lectures,tutoring and quizzes(webtests). This program is great because it serves as a tutor and will walk you step by step through a problem similar through every problem you will encounter in your homework. You can go at your own pace and take as much time as needed. The homework has due dates and we have webtests that give you the results right away;nonetheless, it also shows you why you got it wrong and how to solve it next time. This is great because by the time you get to the in class unit exam you're as prepared as one can be.</Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Response 9</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Karen A.

I am now taking a fourth course with her in my academic career, and over the years I don't think I have ever seen her teach the same way twice. Last semester, our Culture, Pregnancy, and Birth class participated in live Skype sessions with three of the very authors whose books we were reading in the course. I have never heard of anyone else doing such a thing. I actually got to talk to Dorothy Roberts! I really liked how she integrated online forums into the class. The class was a mixed group from different disciplines and academic levels, so this was quite an achievement! We used Google docs to create mind maps out of group work and managed almost all homework, including movie and video clip assignments through Moodle. For all of this, I count myself very fortunate.</Data></Cell></Row>
