There have been several students with defective clickers which is frustrating because generally, that issue generally can't be identified until after the fact (i.e., no points allocated to ID number) and can only be corrected going forward (i.e., get a new clicker).  A recent concern has arisen concerning students entitled to extra time due to a disability but that's more of an application issue.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Suzanne Sevin

It would be very helpful if a message came up and asked us if we would like to reset the session or something similar when we open up Turning Point and then the power point.

I cannot stop students using multiple clickers in a large classroom, leading to widespread cheating.  

Using clickers essentially requires students to attend class and I'm opposed to that.  Classroom behavior is worse than ever when students who do not want to be there are required to attend.

Students had to return them and get new ones b/c the batteries kept dying. I ended up using them so infrequently due to ongoing problems that students were upset and it very negatively affected my course evaluations for that semester.

A problem that you all probably can't deal with but which is one I need advice on: what do I do about students with ongoing disabilities which will occassionally affect their ability to attend class. Since clickers are the way in which I give attendance points, I'm not sure how to assign points for them.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Martha Kropf, 816-309-1589, mekropf@uncc.edu

Clicker slides occasionally freeze, even though there are no animations on them. Have to go through task manager to close the software and start it up again.
2. Students have reported that batteries on new clickers are failing with no notice. Clickers have to be returned to bookstore for replacement. That presents a grading issue. If a student registers a 2nd clicker in Moodle, all grades from the previous clicker disappear. That means that after each class session, I have to merge the 2 class files, export to Moodle type file, import into Moodle, and then export the gradebook from Moodle into Excel. Steps 1-3 have to be done on campus. It's a very awkward time-consuming process. It would be much better to have the scores saved in a database that can be batch uploaded.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Clickers seem to work well even in large sections.
